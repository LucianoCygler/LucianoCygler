# Hi, I'm Luciano! ðŸ‘‹


## ðŸš€ About Me
I'm a Full Stack Developer from Argentina.

I am always looking to learn new skills, put what I have learned into practice to offer solutions and solve problems, assume responsibilities and grow professionally. Motivated and apt for teamwork.

Now my goal is to learn TypeScript because it is highly required by companies and then continue with Java to have a good foundation in programming fundamentals and improve my logical thinking.
